# TAS-seq Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains tools and a pre-trained model for sequence classification in TAS-seq analysis. The core model was trained on randomly sampled biological sequences.

## Key Files
- **`run.sh`**  
  Records the execution pipeline and commands used for running the training/prediction workflow.
  
- **`ma_classifier_model.pth`**  
  Pre-trained PyTorch model for sequence classification. Trained on **200,000 randomly selected sequences** from HEK293T NES data.
